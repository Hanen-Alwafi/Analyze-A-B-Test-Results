# A/B tests 

## For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. the goal is to to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.



By looking at the number mentioned above, we can see that the new treatment page result is slightly less than the result of the control page, 0.119 and 0.120, respectively. Also, the probability that an individual received the new page is 50% which means the probability that an individual received the old page is about 50% too. Based on these numbers, there is no sufficient evidence to say that the new treatment page leads to more conversions.
